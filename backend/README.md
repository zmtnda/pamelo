This is a GraphQL and Sequelize backend for the Pamelo App. 

First things first, to use it or develop on it, run `npm install`.

You can test queries in a web UI by running `npm start` and going to `http://localhost:8080/graphiql`.

If you want to just make queries from your app, make them to `http://localhost:8080/graphql`
