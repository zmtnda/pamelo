					Anyone who’s studied Physics will be familiar with the term vector. I became reacquainted with it while browsing through my high school textbooks, and decided to adapt it as my personal slogan: Become a vector!

					A  vector is a quantity with both magnitude ( a number or “force”), and specific direction, usually represented by an arrow. Why does this matter? Because in your job search it is key to both have a direction as well as to find ways to keep moving further forward along that path.

					In my job search, I’ve become distracted by all the different career opportunities thrown at me, many moving along paths that seem interesting but aren’t right for me. Its important to think of the purpose any job or professional interaction will serve in the long run. Will they  get you closer to your dream career?

					Having been  in the  job market for a short while and having found it frustrating, it’s easy to see how one can get eager, and  desperately jump at any opportunity. It’s important to be patient and always ask whether this will add substance to my  resume?
